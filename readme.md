Introduction
-------------
Given an expression string exp, examine whether the pairs and the orders of “{“,”}”,”(“,”)”,”[“,”]” are correct in expression.

Algorithm
-------------

* Declare a character stack S.
* Now traverse the expression string exp.
	1. If the current character is a starting bracket (‘(‘ or ‘{‘ or ‘[‘) then push it to stack.
	2. If the current character is a closing bracket (‘)’ or ‘}’ or ‘]’) then pop from stack and if the popped character is the matching starting bracket then fine else parenthesis are not balanced.
* After complete traversal, if there is some starting bracket left in stack then “not balanced”
